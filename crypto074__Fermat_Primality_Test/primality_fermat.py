Fermat's Primality Test

    a^{C-1} = 1 mod C


Fermat's little theorem holds for all primes. Hence if a number does not fulfill
Fermat's Little Theorem, it is certainly not a prime.
    a^{prime} = a mod prime
    a^{prime-1} = 1 mod prime   ; as result of multiplying by its inverse

NOTE: The test fails for the rare Carmichael Numbers, e.g. 561

Composite numbers known as Fermat pseudoprimes (or sometimes simply
"pseudoprimes") have zero residue for some as and so are not identified as
composite. Worse still, there exist numbers known as Carmichael numbers (the
smallest of which is 561) which give zero residue for any choice of the base a
relatively prime to p. However, Fermat's little theorem converse provides a
criterion for certifying the primality of a number. A table of the smallest
pseudoprimes P for the first 100 bases a follows (OEIS A007535; Beiler 1966,
p. 42 with typos corrected).

Input
    prime candidate p~ and security parameter s

Output
    statement "p~ is composite" or "p~ is likely prime"

Algorithm
    for i = 1 to s:
        choose random a element of {2, 3, ..., p~ -2}
        if a^{p~ - 1} != 1 mod p~:
            return "p~ is a composite"
    return "p~ is likely prime"
