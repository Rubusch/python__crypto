# Lothar's Crypto Gymnastics

This is a just-for-fun repository mainly from summer 2013! No demands for performance or real world applicability. Perhaps to verify the algorithms (no warranty!) I made this for my own personal understanding of the matter.  

Mainly python sources related to cryptography. Some implementations came out of exercises of the book Understanding Cryptography (Paar, Pelzl, Preneel, 2009). Also Applied Cryptography (Schneier), and other standard literature..
